We notice from the graph that all three of the algorithms follow a similiar pattern to that of O(n*log n).
Out of the 3, Heap sort is the slowest as we see from the plot.
The merge sort is slightly faster than heap sort, but it requires twice the memory of heap sort because of the second array.
The quick sort is faster than merge sort by a very very small margin, but its efficiency can be majorly impacted by which element is chosen as the pivot.
